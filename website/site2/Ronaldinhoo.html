His mother, Dona Miguelina, worked as a saleswoman and trained as a nurse. His father, Jo√£o da Silva Moreira, was a shipyard worker and caretaker of the Gremio Club. Previously, he played for the local amateur team Cruzeiro. It was his father who became the first coach of Ronaldinho, teaching him the game of football, which he practiced on the streets of Vila Nova, where the family lived. In 1987, Ronaldinho began to study by going to Alberto Torres de Vila Nova College, but the love of football took its toll: Ronaldinho could play it all day, and even when his friends could not continue the game due to fatigue, he drove the ball along with with his dog Bombon.</span></h3>
